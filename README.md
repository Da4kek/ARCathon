Implementing reinforcement learning to solve the ARC problem
THE GOAL OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS TO SHOW THAT HUMANS HAVE CERTAIN HARDWIRED INTUITION TO ABSTRACT EVENTS AND THAT REINFORCEMENT LEARNING CAN BE USED ON TOP OF THIS TO MAKE IT FASTER AND FIND DEEPER NON TASK SPECIFIC PATTERNS THAT CAN HELP THE ALGORITHM FIND WHAT TO LOOK FOR TO SOLVE A PROBLEM 
ABSTRACT DESCRIPTION OF THE SKELETON CODE
THE FOLLOWING ARE THE SEQUENCE OF FUNCTIOSN THAT OCCUR -
1)THE IMAGE IS CONVERTED INTO A LIST OF SEGMENTS . THIS IS DONE FOR BOTH THE INPUT AND OUTPUT IMAGES
2)THE SEGMENTS ARE CONVERTED INTO NODES REPRESENTING EVERY SEGMENT IN THAT IMAGE WITH THE PROPERTIES (NUMBER OF EDGES IN THAT SEGMENT , COLOUR OF SEGMENT , EDGE LENGTH , ANGLE BETWEEN ADJACENT EDGES ,THE PIXEL COORDINATES OF THE EDGES  MAKING THAT SEGMENT)
3)A CONNECTION FUNCTION FORMED FORMING VERTICES BETWEEN PROPERTIES OF TWO NODES ,EACH VERTICE HAS THE <>,EQUAL TO OR NOT AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTIES CONNECTED BY THAT VERTICE 
4)THE SEGMENT NODES OF NEIGHBOURING SEGMENTS ARE CONNECTED USING THE CONNECTION FUNCTION ABOVE AND THE SEGMENTS CORRESPONDING TO POSITION OF A SEGMENT IN A IN B  AND IF TWO SEGMENTS HAVE ANY SIMILAR PROPERTY 
5)THE SUPERGRAPH IS FORMED 
6)THE SUPERGRAPH IS CONVERTED INTO SETS OF SUBGRAPHS USING BRUTE FORCE (FOR NOW)
7)A CERTAIN SUBGRAPH OR SET IS TO BE FOUND WHICH IS PRESENT IN ALL THE PAIRS OF IMAGES GIVEN AND CAN ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE SEGMENTS IN THE OUTPUT WITH RESPECT TO THE INPUT IN ALL SAMPLE SETS (NOT CODED YET )
8)IF NO SUCH SUBGRAPH OR SET IS NOT FOUND WE CONVERT THE VERTICES IN THE SUPERGRAPH INTO NODES USING THE " convert_supergrapH"FUNCTION FORMING A DEEPER SUPERGRAPH AND WE RPEAT FROM STEP 6
AFTER WE REACH THE SET OF RULES THAT ACCOMODATE THE OUTPUT WITH RESPECT TO INPUT IN ALL GRAPHS WE USE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING TO MAKE THE BRUTE FORCE SUBGRAPH FINDING MORE EFFICIENT AND FINDING CERTAIN SUBGRAPHS WHICH WERE HELPFUL IN REACHING THE GOAL
